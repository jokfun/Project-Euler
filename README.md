# Euler Project

This is a directory of the different algorithmic challenges proposed on the Euler project (https://projecteuler.net/). 
The algorithms are sorted according to the pages of the site and everything is coded in python.
Beware, some algorithms are not perfectly optimized, but all of them produce the right output.

## The project 

"Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context."
